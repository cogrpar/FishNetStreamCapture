# FishNetStreamCapture

This repo serves as a temporary database to track detected fish over time from our cameras.  
We have plans to migrate to using AWS for this purpose in the future.
**This repository is a fork of the [FishNET Stream Capture](https://github.com/SVVSDICAI/FishNetStreamCapture.git) repository.  It is used to store the results of the FishNET AI back-end.**
